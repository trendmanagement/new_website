                            Definitions: TMQR Exo Index is compiled by Trend Management Limited. It is rebalanced as stated in the description page in line with the stated index goals including reinvestment and refunding. Performance is shown net of all performance fees and provides a rules-based and investable index, enabling investors to utilize the performance of a concentrated investment process or strategy. It is the exclusive property of Trend Management Limited. Model Risks: The investment strategy described herein relies on proprietary models and predictions with regard to the performance of an asset class or particular investment generated by these models and may not be accurate because of imperfections in the models, their deterioration over time, or other factors, such as the quality of the data input into the model, which involves the exercise of judgment. Even if the model functions as anticipated, it cannot account for all factors that may influence the prices of the investments, such as event risk.

                            Important Legal Information Regarding Hypothetical, Back-Tested or Simulated Performance: the hypothetical performance shown is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual performance. Simulations for the Trend Management Limited Exo Indices were conducted to measure how a portfolio of futures and options designed to track specific trading goals outlined would have performed. Returns were simulated assuming nominal transaction costs for execution at daily closing prices. Any invested or borrowed cash earned or paid interest at market rates. Monthly index Margin to equity targets were computed continuously and rebalanced by the specified roll date. Index rebalancing occurred on the first day after the portfolio weights were computed and for which all instruments involved in the rebalancing process were available to be traded. The platform on which this testing was performed is a proprietary system developed at Trend Management Limited. All simulations were conducted by Trend Management Limited.

                            Hypothetical, back-tested or simulated performances have many inherent limitations only some of which are described as follows: It is designed with the benefit of hindsight, based on historical data, and does not reflect the impact that certain economic and market factors might have had on the decision or rule-making process. No hypothetical, back-tested or simulated performance can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual performance. Therefore, it will invariably show positive returns. The information is based, in part, on hypothetical assumptions made for modeling purposes that may not be realized in the actual performance.

                            No representation or warranty is made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions made or that all assumptions used in achieving the returns have been stated or fully considered. Assumption changes may have a material impact on the model returns presented. There are frequently material differences between hypothetical, back-tested or simulated performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.

                            Unlike an actual performance, hypothetical, back-tested or simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. The back-testing of performance differs from actual performance because the allocation rules may be adjusted at any time, for any reason and can continue to be changed until desired or better performance results are achieved. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical, back-tested and simulated performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved. The Indices are not securities and cannot be purchased. The charts, tables and graphs contained in this document are not intended to be used to assist the reader in determining which securities to buy or sell or when to buy or sell securities.

                            Benchmarks are used solely for purposes of comparison and the comparison does not mean that there will necessarily be a correlation between the returns described herein and the benchmarks.

Information containing any historical information, data or analysis should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of any future performance, analysis, forecast or prediction.

                            The Index returns shown do not represent the results of actual trading of investable assets/securities. Trend Management Limited maintains the Indices and calculates the Index levels and performance shown or discussed, but does not manage actual assets. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the Index or investment funds that are intended to track the performance of the Index. The imposition of these fees and charges would cause actual and back-tested performance of the securities/fund to be lower than the Index performance shown. Back-tested performance may not reflect the impact that any material market or economic factors might have had on the advisor's management of actual client assets.
